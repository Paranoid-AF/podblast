# Podchat
Podchat is a desktop app for podcasts and various kinds of audio content, with extension support.

This project is still a work in progress, so it's functionalities are not fully implemented yet. In short: it's not even usable.

## Configuration
In order to start developing this app, you need to prepare the environment first.

First, you need to install packages.
```shell
npm install
# OR
yarn
```

It would also build native libraries for Electron on your platform.

If everything works fine so far, run the app with:
```shell
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

## Building the App
To building the app, run the following command.

```shell
npm run build
# OR
yarn build
```

However, the build program is not completely set-up yet, but it would still build the app and its installer for your platform.
